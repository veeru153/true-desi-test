# True Desi Test

### The True Desi Test is a parody of the Rice Purity Test.

It's a voluntary opportunity for people to test their "desi" tendencies and find out how "desi" they really are.

Inspired by the True Asian Test that was spread on 'subtle asian traits' which was more oriented towards East Asians.

My friends and I got together on Discord and made this little project.
